I am a computer science student in my junior year at CSUF, expected to graduate in 2026

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 7 part-1: 
	I really liked this code because it was extra tricky because of the time requirements we had to meet. The complexity of the code was a lot of fun and made it more interesting to code. It was definitely my favorite as it made me think really hard about what I needed to apply to make the code to work. I liked using the functions and because it was so new to me at the time it made me realize how helpful it is to not have all the code just crammed in one space.  

* Lab 9 part-2:
	My second favorite is one of the simple guessing games we made, this one specifically was using a data file and using one code to add the secret number to the list and the other for the actual guesses. This is actually a more practical way of doing this to actually gain an input from the user instead of reinitializing a new secret number every time the code runs.

* Lab 10 part-1:
	This was an interesting code because we used a header file to be able to find the county and state population from just the input of a county name. We put into practice the vectors and const functions we learned in class and used different functions to be able to return certain outputs.
